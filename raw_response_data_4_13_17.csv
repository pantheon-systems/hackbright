I had to answer a question about my racial identify, but I don't relate to that either. In Canada we don't tend to categorize people according to race as much as they do in the US, so that may be why. It's not something I think about. Surely in part because I am white, but also because my culture doensn't empahsize this. The class questions were also very difficult to answer - I don't relate to those class boundaries at all. It might have been interesting to add a ""I don't relate to this question"" option for many of these. Maybe people in the minority groups would be more likely to identify with certain options.",0

Actually, in Technology, I'd say that expressing a Christian identity, at least for me, is very hard. There is so much judgmentalism associated with Christianity and anti-Christian perspectives are often still seen as the underdog (though the Biblical worldview is held by a very small minority in almost all English-speaking, developed countries). Or maybe it's that ""enlightened"" perspectives perceive Christianity as entirely stone age and ""stupid""? Certainly Christians, as a group, have done much to incur wrath, ridicule, and disdain. But like any group, especially any large group, it's very complex and diverse. I'd say much of this applies to religion in general within Technology, since the religion of Technology is Naturalism, and any competitor to that is viewed with disdain and suspicion.",8
